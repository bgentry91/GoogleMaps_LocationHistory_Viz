# GoogleMaps Location History Visualization

Visualization of GoogleMaps Location History using [gmplot](https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot). 

Download your own .json file from Google Timeline, set your map window, and it should work for you!

Example image (me, 2017) I traveled more than this, but too much zoom causes clarity loss:
